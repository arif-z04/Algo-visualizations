# Algorithm Visualization

Welcome to the **Algorithm Visualization** repository! This project provides a visual and interactive representation of sorting algorithms, making it easier to understand their inner workings.

## About the Project

This repository is primarily focused on visualizing algorithms, starting with the Bubble Sort algorithm. The aim is to provide an engaging way to learn and teach algorithm concepts through dynamic visualizations using Python and Matplotlib.

## Features

- **Dynamic Visualization**: Observe how algorithms process data step by step.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Configure the size of the dataset and range of random values.
- **Real-Time Updates**: See elements change color and height during execution for better clarity.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.8+
- Matplotlib library

You can install the required library using pip:

```bash
pip install matplotlib
```

### Running the Visualization

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arif-z04/Algo-visualizations.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd algo-visualizations
   ```

3. Run the Python script:

   ```bash
   python <algorithm_name>.py
   ```

4. Watch the algorithm in action!

## How It Works

The script generates an array of random integers and sorts it using the Bubble Sort algorithm. During each iteration:

- Bars representing elements are updated to reflect their current values.
- Moving elements are highlighted in **red**.
- Stable elements remain **blue**.

## Future Enhancements

This repository is a work in progress, and we plan to include:

- Visualizations for other algorithms (e.g., Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort).
- Support for more data structures and algorithms.
- An interactive web-based UI.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have ideas or improvements, feel free to:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature.
3. Submit a pull request.
