# Algorithm Visualization

Welcome to the **Algorithm Visualization** repository! This project provides a visual and interactive representation of sorting algorithms, making it easier to understand their inner workings.

## About the Project

This repository is primarily focused on visualizing algorithms, starting with **sorting algorithms**. The aim is to provide an engaging way to learn and teach algorithm concepts through dynamic visualizations using Python and Matplotlib.

## Features

- **Dynamic Visualization**: Observe how algorithms process data step by step.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Configure the size of the dataset and range of random values.
- **Real-Time Updates**: See elements change color and height during execution for better clarity.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.8+
- Matplotlib library

You can install the required library using pip:

```bash
pip install matplotlib
```

### Running the Visualization

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arif-z04/Algo-visualizations.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Algo-visualizations
   ```

3. Run the Python script:

   ```bash
   python <algorithm_name>.py
   ```

4. Watch the algorithm in action!

## How It Works

The script generates an array of random integers and sorts it using the Bubble Sort algorithm. During each iteration:

- Bars representing elements are updated to reflect their current values.
- Moving elements are highlighted in **red**.
- Stable elements remain **blue**.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have ideas or improvements, feel free to:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature.
3. Submit a pull request.
